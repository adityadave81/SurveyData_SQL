## SurveyData_SQL
This is the final project that I did for Database Programming at Pace University. In this project I implemented end to end ETL process and also displayed proficiency with Stored Procedures, Cursors, etc.

./Create_table/Project_TableCreateQuery_Final_Final.sql - This is the create query for SurverDB.  
./Insert_Queries/Table_Insert - Queries for inserting data from Adults.csv file.  
./StoredProcedures/* - Stored Procedures for performing analysis on Survey data.
./Adult.csv - Main .csv file containing all the survey data.  
./Database_Export/SurveyDB_Export - Direct dump of entire database with Stored Procedures, events and triggers.
./ERDiagram.jpeg - Entity Relationship Diagram for the Adult1 Database.

## Work Done
1. Created a database schema for Adult database.  
2. Normalized the data in Adults.csv up to 3NF(3rd Normal Form).
3. Wrote queries for creating database, inserting values from csv file to the respective tables.
4. Created Stored Procedures in order to reduce the time complexity.

## Implementation
1. Use "Table data import wizard" and store the data in "Adults.csv" file in a dummy table.  
2. Use Create_table in order to create all the necessary tables.  
3. Use Table_Insert.sql in order to insert data from the dummy table where data  from 'Adults.csv' is stored.  
4. Now the database is ready for use and you can perform any queries that you want to. Some of the example queries are in "StoredProcedures" folder.
